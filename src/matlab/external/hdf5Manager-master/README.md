hdf5 Data Manager
=================

The hdf5 Data Manager can be used for viewing, displaying and analyzing data as well as viewing attributes 
stored in the hdf5 format. The viewer is generic and supports any data structure stored in 
the hdf5 format.

Features

* Data can be send to an iPython console which allows further analysis, manipulation or displaying.
